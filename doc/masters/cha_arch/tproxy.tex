\section{Transport Proxy component}
\label{sec:arch_tproxy}

Transport proxies are components responsible for communication with external components that perform actual, low-level analysis of processing tree and measurements. Each proxy implementation specializes generic, ontology based concept into item specific to platform or measuring system. All transport proxies implementations are being used by Monitoring Hub component, and distributed in form of library (Java JAR). 

Because all proxies have rather straight purpose, further decomposition of those components won't be provided. In following subsection, I would like to cover overall design principles of two transport proxies provided with initial implementation of SemSimMon system.

\subsection{JMX Transport Proxy}

Implementation of transport proxy component responsible for integration with Java JMX consist of one root component - JmxTransportProxy, several DiscoveryAgent and CapabilityProbe components. JmxTransportProxy component implements interface used by other high-level system modules and performs all operations, delegating requests to appropriate probes or discovery agents.

DiscoveryAgents are responsible for fetching all sub resources of given resource. Each agent can be interpreted as a mapping between ontology based, generic concept and item specific to JVM domain. Additionally, agents are responsible for gathering all static properties of all discovered components.

If DiscoveryAgent can be seen as mapping between resource and JMX-specific entity, then CapabilityProbe should be interpreted as mapping between generic capability described by ontology language and JMX specific feature. The only responsibility of CapabilityProbe is to fetch value of capability that it can measure using given resource as an input.

To fulfill its duties, JmxTransportProxy component maintains maps of discovery agents and capability probes. In both cases map associates ontology URL of given concept to explicit probe or agent. Additionally it is responsible for setting up and maintaining connection to JVMs.

\subsection{OCM-G Transport Proxy}

OCM-G Transport Proxy component integrates SemSimMon with distributed monitoring system compliant with OMIS interface specification. This implementation will use OMIS java bindings developed under OCM-G project. Design of this component is similar to JMX transport proxy - there will be one OcmgTransportProxy component, responsible for maintaining connections, associations and several probes and discovery agents.
