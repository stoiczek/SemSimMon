\section{Transport Proxy component}
\label{sec:arch_tproxy}
 
Transport proxies are components responsible for communicating with external components that performs actual, low-level
analysis of processing tree and measurements. Each proxy implementation can specialize generic, ontology base concept
into item specific to platform or measuring system. All transport proxies implementation are being used by Monitoring
Hub component, and distributed in form of library (Java JAR). 

Because all proxies has rather straight purpose, further decomposition of those components won't be provided. In
following subsection, author covers overall design principles of Two transport proxies provided with initial
implementation of SemSimMon system.

 
\subsection{JMX Transport Proxy}

Implementation of transport proxy component responsible for integration with Java JMX consist of one root component -
JmxTransportProxy, several DiscoveryAgent and CapabilityProbe components. JmxTransportProxy component implements
interface used by other high-level system modules and performs all operations, delegating requests to appropriate
probes or discovery agents.

DiscoveryAgents are responsible for fetching all subresources of given resource. Each agent can be interpreted as a
mapping between ontology based, generic concept and item specific to JVM domain. Additionally, agents are responsible
for gathering all static properties of all discovered components.

If DiscoveryAgent can be seen as mapping between resource and JMX-specific entity, then CapabilityProbe should be
interpreted as mapping between generic capability described by ontology language into JMX specific feature. The only
responsibility of CapabilityProbe is to fetch value of capability that it can measure and using given resource.

To fulfill it's duties, JmxTransportProxy component maintains maps of discovery agents and capability probes. In both
cases map associates ontology URL of given concept to explicit probe or agent. Additionally it is responsible for
setting up and maintaining connection to JVM.


\subsection{OCM-G Transport Proxy}

OCM-G Transport Proxy component integrates SemSimMon with distributed monitoring system compliant with OMIS interface
specification. This implementation will use OMIS java bindings developed under OCM-G project. Because this transport
proxy implements similar functionality that JMX transport proxy,
