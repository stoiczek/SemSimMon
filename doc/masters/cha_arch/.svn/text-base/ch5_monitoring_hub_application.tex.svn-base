\label{sec:ch5_monitoring_hub_application}

Monitoring Hub Application is component with one only, but crucial for using system in distributed manner - it allows
using Monitoring Hub remotely. It is packaged as standalone, command line application. 

Because of rather narrow functionality, further decomposition of Monitoring Hub Application. It will contain code
responsible for starting application (main method), initializing components of Monitoring Hub, resolving dependencies
between components.

Additionally, in order to provide its distributed services, Monitoring Hub Application is responsible for
initialization of remoting context. This includes creation of all remote services and export of Monitoring Hub
functionalities to remote clients exposing it's services using ready to use middleware. 

What is pretty obvious, to be able to export Monitoring Hub services to remote client this component must be a
dependency to Monitoring Hub Application.
