{\small
This chapter focuses on a design aspect of software development. At the beginning, I would like to share basic principles, that I have been trying to follow while designing the application. Rest of the chapter covers top-to-bottom analysis of system architecture. First there is a decomposition of top-level components and their interactions (modules). Following subsequent sections cover more detailed analysis and decomposition of high-level modules.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:gui}

Design stage is probably most influential in whole life cycle of an application. Decisions made during this stage affect all following ones. Properly designed architecture of the system or application reduces the possibility of pitfalls during the implementation stage. It also allows easier extension, growth of application, as well as better integration with other systems, thus extends application lifetime.

While designing application, I have been trying to follow few, well known, software design principles, like:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Single Responsibility

principle}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak Application should be divided into distinct features with as little overlap as possible. Architecture should strain to minimize the amount of interaction points to achieve a high cohesion and low coupling.

\item {\bf Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter~-~LoD)}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak Each component or module should be responsible for only a specific feature or functionality, or aggregation of cohesive functionality.

\item {\bf Do not repeat yourself (DRY)}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak One should only need to specify intent in one place. For example, in terms of application design, functionality should be implemented in only one component; the functionality should not be duplicated in any other component.

\item {\bf Keep It Simple Stupid! (KISS)}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak it is a broad principle, but works in software architecture domain quite well. Generally speaking, it states that while designing application, one should try to avoid creating unnecessarily complex structures.
\end{itemize}

In this chapter, I would like to describe the architecture of the proposed system. First, in Section~\ref{sec:arch_decomposition} I will try to distinguish high-level components, describe them roughly and present most critical data flows between them. Following subsequent sections (\ref{sec:arch_gui}, \ref{sec:arch_monitoring_hub}, \ref{sec:arch_monitoring_hub_application} , \ref{sec:arch_knowledge}, and \ref{sec:arch_tproxy}) contain deeper analysis of each high-level component.
