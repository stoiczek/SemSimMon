\chapter{System architecture}
\label{cha:sys_arch}

\chabstract{
This chapter focuses on the design aspect of software development. At the beginning, I would like to share the basic principles, that I have been trying to follow while designing the application. The rest of the chapter covers a top-to-bottom analysis of system architecture. First there is a decomposition of top-level components and their interactions (modules). The subsequent sections cover a more detailed analysis and a decomposition of the high-level modules.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:gui}

Design stage is probably the most influential in the whole life cycle of an application. Decisions made during this stage affect the all the following ones. A properly designed architecture of the a system or an application reduces the possibility of pitfalls during the implementation stage. It also allows easier extension, growth of application, as well as better integration with other systems; thus, extends application lifetime.

While designing the application under discussion, I was trying to follow a few, well known, software design principles, like:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Single Responsibility

principle}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak Application should be divided into distinct features with as little overlap as possible. Architecture should strain to minimize the amount of interaction points to achieve a high cohesion and low coupling.

\item {\bf Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter~-~LoD)}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak Each component or module should be responsible for only a specific feature or functionality, or aggregation of cohesive functionality.

\item {\bf Do not repeat yourself (DRY)}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak One should only specify an intent in one place. For example, in terms of application design, functionality should be implemented in only one component; the functionality should not be duplicated in any other component.

\item {\bf Keep It Simple Stupid! (KISS)}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\linebreak it is a broad principle, but works in software architecture domain quite well. Generally speaking, it states that while designing an application, one should try to avoid creating unnecessarily complex structures.
\end{itemize}

In this chapter, I am going to describe the architecture of the proposed system. First, in Section~\ref{sec:arch_decomposition} I will try to distinguish high-level components, describe them roughly and present most critical data flows between them. The subsequent sections (\ref{sec:arch_gui}, \ref{sec:arch_monitoring_hub}, \ref{sec:arch_monitoring_hub_application} , \ref{sec:arch_knowledge}, and \ref{sec:arch_tproxy}) contain a deeper analysis of each high-level component.
