\section{System Requirements}
\label{sec:SystemRequirements}

This section contains requirements that SemSimMon, as a product must meet. Requirements listing and description is
divided into two categories, namely  functional and non-functional requirements. Main purpose of functional requirements
analysis is to key out roughly what user can do with application, to describe its functionality . On the other hand,
nonfunctional requirements adds constraints to functional ones. Nonfunctional requirements analysis defines
conditions under which application must operate, specify properties the software must exhibit\cite{Windle:SoftReq}.

Requirement levels described in the following Requirements specifications using terms such as ``must'', ``must
not'', ``should/shall'' and ``should/shall not'' are to be read with reference to RFC 2119\cite{rfc:2119}.


\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{subsec:FunctionalRequirements}

Application must give user ability to perform following actions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf Connect to already running JVM process using JMX extension.} 

Application should allow end user to connect to application that has been previously started. User should be able to
connect to both remote or local Virtual Machine process. Additionally, to allow monitoring of environment to which user
has poor connection, or to bypass firewall restrictions, user should be able to start component responsible for remote
measuring. This component shall aggregate results from one or more measurements and sends them to component controlled
directly by user in packaged manner.

 \item {\bf Aggregate monitored JVM processes into applications and clusters.}

User should be able to manage existing connections to processes being monitored in easy fashion, thus should be able to
group them into logical units like clusters (group of nodes) or applications (collection of nodes or clusters that
runs same program)

 \item {\bf Connect to already running OCM-G MainSM monitor.}

User must be able to analyze performance of applications being monitored by OCM-G system. To allow
this, application must provide facility for connecting to MainSM monitor, list already registered applications and
attach to selected one. Requirements related to environments to which user has limited access (int therms of
network quality) applies here. Additionally, user should be able to work with both resource types (based on JMX and
OCM-G monitoring beck-ends) in same time, with seamless integration (user shouldn't perform any action to switch
context of work).

 \item {\bf Extract and list resources of given resource.}

Application should be able to perform deep discovery mechanisms of monitored resources and visualize them.

 \item {\bf Control measuring capabilities of given resource.}

Application must provide facility to start, stop, pause and resume monitoring of given resource's capability. This
includes also definition of value gathering interval. Additionally user should be able to configure and update
parameters of measurement, like polling frequency. 

 \item {\bf List values of given resource's capabilities at current point of time.}

Per user request, application should provide value of given capability (or multiple capabilities at once) at
given moment of time.

 \item {\bf List all capability values from given, started measurement.}

After starting measurement user should be able to view all values of given capability (in context of resource) since
start of measurement. Each value should be displayed with timestamp pointing exact moment when measurement was
taken. Additionally, view that will show those values must be able to autorefresh on-line in case of pending
measurements.

 \item {\bf Visualize measurement results.}

User must be able to select measurement and plot results on graph. User should be able to choose from more than one
graph type. Each graph should be able to render results from multiple measurements. Plots should be updated on-line with
new values of pending measurements.

\item {\bf List properties of given resource.}

User should be able view all static meta-data of given, selected, resource. By static meta-data I mean attributes of
resource that doesn't change in time, like: host name, OS version, JVM version, etc.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}
\label{subsec:NonFunctionalRequirements}

SemSimMon shall meet following non functional requirements:

\begin{itemize}

 \item {\bf Reliability.}

It's the most important nonfunctional requirement. Application cannot have any critical bugs that can cause it crash.
Application's failure, cannot lead to data loss. 

 \item {\bf Scalability.}

User should be able to work with wide variety of environments - from single process running on single host, up to
highly distributed application running on several clusters containing vast amount of computing units.

 \item {\bf Interoperability.}

Application should operate on most currently available platforms: Linux, Microsoft\textregistered~Windows\textregistered
or Mac OS X\textregistered.

\item {\bf Usability.}

User interface should be as much user-friendly as it's possible. User shouldn't loose time on learning how application
actually works. Each function should be just in the place, where casual user will expect it to be.

 \item {\bf Driven by Open Source.}

To allow extend of application's life cycle, it's development should be based on open source resources.

 \item {\bf Well documented.}

Extensive documentation is crucial to allow other developers contributing to the project.

\end{itemize}
