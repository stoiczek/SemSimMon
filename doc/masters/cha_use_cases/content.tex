\chapter{Requirements and Use Cases}
\label{cha:requirements}

\chabstract{
This chapter is the first one focusing solely on the aim of this thesis - creation of a application performance measuring tool. In order to actually start the work on a new software project, one must first define what actually system should do. This is exactly the purpose of this chapter. First I am covering a requirements analysis. Reader may find here a clear definition of requirements that a system to be implemented should meet in a less formal notation of plain English. The second section of this chapter tries to structurize these requirements into the form of UML use cases.
