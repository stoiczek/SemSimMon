\section{Working with application}
\label{sec:ch7_working_with}

Within this section, I will try to introduce the end-user with initial knowledge that needs to be learned in order to use application. Only real basics will be covered here, like system deliverable structure, basic installation guideline, requirements, etc.

The main and only one deliverable containing fully-functional system is package built from GUI submodule. This component\rq{}s building script defines dependencies to all other components that needs to be obtained in order to use application. The application package comes in a form of zip archive or gzipped tarball. 

To build application, one should just issue {\bf mvn package} command, using any command line environment (bash, csh, cmd.exe) from project root - SemSimMon directory. As a result, application bundle can be found in directory SemSimMon/gui/target/gui-bin.{tar.gz,zip}.

Application bundle contains following items:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf lib} directory, containing all Java binaries. It includes libraries with SemSimMon components as well as their dependencies.
  \item {\bf resources} directory, containing other resources. Currently, within this directory, there is only package with Monitoring Hub Application component - {\bf mon-hub-app.tar.gz} archive.
  \item {\bf semsimmon-gui.bat} and {\bf semsimmon-gui.sh} scripts. Those scripts should be used to launch the application	
\end{itemize}  

In order to install application, one needs just to extract above archive in desired directory. Additionally, at least at the moment, startup scripts does not bother about finding Java executable, so user must have Java Runtime Environment binaries available from PATH system variable. To start GUI application, user needs to navigate to directory where it was installed, and simply launch appropriate script.

The mon-hub-app.tar.gz package is used internally by GUI, to automatically deploy Monitoring Hub Application into desired host/ Because of that, if user removes the archive, automatic deployment will simply fail. Additionally, user may manually deploy Monitoring Hub. To do so, one must just send package to desired host, unpack it into selected directory, and start by invoking script {\bf monhub-app.sh} or {\bf monhub-app.bat} that can be found inside of the package. 

The bash version of script, takes two parameters as an input - the first one is action, and can be either \lq{}start\rq{} or \lq{}stop\rq{}. Start will just launch this component in a background, stop will terminate background process started previously. Additionally, when starting hub, one must define which interface will be used to listen for GUI connections. It must be given as second parameter, if first is \lq{}start\rq{} and should be either an IP address or interface\rq{}s DNS alias.  

Because Windows does not support starting background tasks in cmd.exe, the startup script on this platform takes just one parameter - listening interface. Proper values are same as in bash version - either IP  address or DNS name.
