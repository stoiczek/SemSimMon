\chapter{System deployment and running}
\label{cha:deployment}

Although ease of use was one of most important design goals, description of deployment, usage, example sessions is still needed. This chapter focuses solely on those issues. Within Section~\ref{sec:deployments} I\rq{}ll try to cover basic deployment scenarios, from simplest including only single PC that runs all tools - monitored application, Monitoring Hub and Gui up to distributed approach where all components are spread across multiple hosts. Section~\ref{sec:working_with} describes roughly process of using application - installation, running and so on.
