{\small
Although ease of use was one of most important design goals, description of deployment, usage, and example sessions is still needed. This chapter focuses solely on those issues. First I will try to cover basic deployment scenarios, from simplest including only single PC that runs all tools - monitored application, Monitoring Hub and GUI up to distributed approach where all components are spread across multiple hosts. Next section describes roughly usage of application - installation, starting up and describes in few steps how to perform most important actions within application. One should treat this section as minimalistic approach to user guide. The last section within this chapter, covers tests performed on the application. There were two types of tests performed - performance and usability. With performance test I would like to proof that aren\rq{}t any technical caveats with using the application. On the other hand, usability test describes real use case of application, which aims in proving application usability.
