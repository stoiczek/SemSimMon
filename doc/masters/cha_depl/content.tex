{\small
Although the easiness of use was one of the most notable design goals, a description of deployment, usage, and example sessions is still needed. This chapter focuses solely on these issues. First I will try to cover basic deployment scenarios, from the simplest including only a single PC that runs all tools - monitored application, Monitoring Hub and GUI up to a distributed approach where all components are spread across multiple hosts. Section ~\ref{sec:ch7_working_with} describes roughly use of the application - installation, starting up and describes in a few steps how to perform the most significant actions within the application. One should treat this section as a minimalistic approach to user guide. The last section of this chapter covers tests performed on the application. There were two types of tests performed - performance and usability. With performance test, I would like to proof that there are no technical caveats when using the application. On the other hand, a usability test describes a real use case of the application, which aims at proving the application\rq{}s usefulness.
