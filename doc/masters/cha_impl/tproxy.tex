\section{Transport Proxy Implementation}

\subsection{JMX Transport Proxy Implementation}

JMX Transport Proxy is built around two concepts: a discovery agent and a capability probe. The implementation consist of the following discovery agent classes:

\begin{itemize} 
  \item{\bf{GCDiscoveryAgent}} - discovers garbage collectors 
  \item{\bf{ThreadsDiscoveryAgent}} - discovers all threads running in a single JVM
  \item{\bf{CPUDiscoveryAgent}} - discovers CPUs on a given computing node
  \item{\bf{JvmDiscoveryAgent}} - discovers a JVM running on a node
  \item{\bf{OsDiscoveryAgent}} - discovers an operating system that runs on a given node
\end{itemize} 

Additionally the JMX Transport proxy uses the following probes to fetch capability values: 

\begin{itemize} 
  \item{\bf{GarbageCollectionsProbe}} - gets the values of a Garbage Collector related capabilities (\texttt{CollectionCountCapability} and \texttt{CollectionTimeCapability})
  \item{\bf{MemoryProbe}} - gathers the values of memory related capabilities: total, free and used. It is used in conjunction with both a physical and a virtual memory resources
  \item{\bf{HeapProbe}} - measures the heap usage  
  \item{\bf{ThreadTimingProbe}} - monitors thread timings: the \texttt{ThreadCPUTimeCapability} and \texttt{ThreadUserTimeCapability} capabilities
  \item{\bf{ThreadSynchronizationDetailsProbe}} - monitors capabilities related to a thread synchronization: \texttt{ThreadBlockedCountCapability}, \texttt{ThreadBlockedTimeCapability}, \texttt{ThreadWaitedCountCapability} and \texttt{ThreadWaitedTimeCapability}
  \item{\bf{JmxQueryCapabilityProbe}} - a generic probe that can measure capabilities using a JMX query
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{OCM-G Transport Proxy Implementation}

The OCM-G Transport Proxy implementation uses a similar approach as JMX one. In this case, there are also two concepts employed: probes (works in the same way as in JMX Transport Proxy) and resource agents. The OCM-G proxy consists of resource agents instead of discovery agents, because the OCM-G has means to actually manage resources and these means are used in the SemSimMon. Thus, resource agents have two purposes - discovery and management of resources.

There are the following resource agents implemented:

\begin{itemize} 
  \item{\bf{AppsResourceAgent}} - manages applications monitored by a given MainSM
  \item{\bf{ClustersResourceAgent}} - manages clusters within a given application
  \item{\bf{NodeResourceAgent}} - manages nodes within a given cluster
  \item{\bf{ProcessFunctionsResourceAgent}} - manages function resources
  \item{\bf{ThreadResourceAgent}} - manages threads
  \item{\bf{CpuResourceAgent}} - manages processors
  \item{\bf{NetIfaceResourceAgent}} - manages network interfaces
  \item{\bf{OSResourceAgent}} - manages operating systems
  \item{\bf{PhysicalMemoryRA}} - manages physical memory
  \item{\bf{ProcessResourceAgent}} - manages processes
  \item{\bf{StorageResourceAgent}} - manages storage devices
  \item{\bf{VirtualMemoryRA}} - manages virtual memory
 \end{itemize} 
  
The OCM-G Transport Proxy uses the following probes:

\begin{itemize} 
  \item{\bf{LoadAvgProbe}} - measures the node\rq{}s load average 
  \item{\bf{ThreadsCP}} - measures capabilities related to threads (total and live threads count)
  \item{\bf{TotalCpuTimeCapabilityProbe}} - measures total CPU time of a process
  \item{\bf{FunctionProbe}} - measures capabilities related to functions (\texttt{TotalCallsTimeCapability} and \texttt{TotalCallsCountCapability})
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{TransportProxy interface}
\label{subs:TransportProxyInterface}

Although Transport Proxies are components where most of the \lq\lq{}magic\rq\rq{} occurs, their implementation is relatively simple. To use the functionalities provided by this component, the Monitoring Hub uses only a single interface shown in Figure~\ref{fig:transport_proxy}.

  \label{fig:transport_proxy}
\end{figure} 

Additionally, to extend the application by new transport proxy even more simple, the \texttt{BaseTransportProxy} class was introduced. Its main purpose is to implement most of functionalities that are not aware of the underlying communication mechanisms. Because of that to add a new transport proxy, one should just create a new class that inherits from the \texttt{BaseTransportProxy} and implement only abstract methods that are defined there.
