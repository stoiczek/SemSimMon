\chapter{Implementation details}
\label{cha:implementation}

Within this chapter dear may find rough implementation details of SemSimMon application. I don't intent to cover
source code in detail, instead I'd like to describe most important interfaces, technologies that were employed during 
implementation and will try to bring some light on source code structure. The main goal I want to achieve with it is to 
lower the learning curve, needed to continue working on the project by other developers.

\section{Implementation technologies}

As a whole SemSimMon was written using Java programming language.
