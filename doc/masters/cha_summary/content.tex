\chapter{Summary}
\label{cha:summary}

\chabstract{
In the last chapter of this work, I would like to close the work done, by summing it up. In the first section, there is the achievements analysis, made in the context of requirements defined at the beginning of Thesis. It contains a summary of each functional and nonfunctional requirement, with a short description of the level of completeness. In the next section, I am going to share some ideas about potential improvements that could be implemented by someone who decides to continue this effort. Finally, there is a rough, personal summary of the work accomplished, in the last section.
