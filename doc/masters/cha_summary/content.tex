{\small
In the last chapter of this work, I would like to close the work made, by summing it up. First one may found achievements analysis in the context of requirements defined at the beginning of this thesis. It contains a summary of every functional and nonfunctional requirement, with a short description covering level of completeness. In the next section, I would like to share some ideas about potential improvements that could be implemented by someone who would like to continue this effort. Additionally, there is rough, personal summary of work accomplished at the end of this chapter.
