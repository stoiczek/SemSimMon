\chapter{Summary}
\label{cha:summary}

\chabstract{
In the last chapter of this work, I would like to close the work done, by summing it up. In the first section, there is the achievements analysis, made in the context of requirements defined at the beginning of the Thesis. It contains a summary of every functional and nonfunctional requirement, with a short description, covering a level of a completeness. In the next section, I would like to share some ideas about potential improvements that could be implemented by someone who would like to continue this effort. Finally, there is rough, personal summary of work accomplished, in the last section.
