{\small
In last chapter of this work, I would like to close the work made, by summing it up. First one may found achievements analysis in context of requirements defined at the beginning of this thesis.  Every functional and non-functional  requirement is being summed up there, with short description covering level of completeness. In next section, I would like to share some ideas about potential improvements that could be implemented by someone who would like to continue this effort. At the end of this chapter there is rough, personal summary of work done.
