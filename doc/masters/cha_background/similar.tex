\subsection{perfSonar}

perfSonar (\cite{perfSonar1,perfSonar2,perfSonar3}) is an infrastructure for network performance monitoring. It aims in easing solve end-to-end performance problems on paths that crosses several networks. It is composed of a set of services delivering performance measurements in federated environment. This approach allows to classify project as a middle were service, used by performance measuring tools and diagnostic or visualization applications. The layer created by perfSonar aims to make and exchange performance measurements between networks, using well-defined protocols.  Architecture of perfSONAR is service oriented, which means that the set of elementary functions have been isolated and can be provided by several, independent entities (\emph{services}).

Work done on perSONAR is made around three contexts. First, there is a consortium of organizations who build network of performance middleware that is interoperable across multiple networks and useful for variate network analysis. The second context is a protocol. It is build on assumption of fixed, well defined roles (service types) and defines communication between components implementing each role. Such a approach allows interoperability. What is also worth mentioning, is that the protocol is based on SOAP XML messages format and follows Network Measurement Working Group\footnote{\url{http://nmwg.internet2.edu}} schema.  The third context is set of implemented software packages that provides defined services.


The framework has already defined several types of services. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item{ {\bf Measurement Point Service}, acts as a service provider. Standard doesn\rq{}t define whether it gathers measurement values dynamically, by querying measured components or retrieves static, archived data. It defines only it\rq{}s role as a source of measurement values. }
\item{ {\bf Measurement Archive Service}, is responsible for archivization. It can use any storage facility underneath (Round Robin Database or any RDBMS). Additionally it can publish received information. }
\item{ {\bf Lookup Service}, enables services to discover other services. It acts as service directory, where service can advertise themselves and requestors are able to find any service needed}
\item{ {\bf Authentication Service}, helps domains which would like to restrict access to given service capabilities for some groups of users. It is responsible for both authorization (who is given user) and authentication - it acts as so called attribute authority (decides which attribute can be disclosed to a resource)}
\item{ {\bf Transformation Service}, is generic service type that allows creation of data conversion pipelines. It is able to perform any function upon data taken from producer and returns transformed data to consumer}
\item{ {\bf Topology Service}, provides the framework informations about network topology, which allows for example visualization of network maps. Additionally it gives information on geolocation, like GPS coordinates.}
\item{ {\bf Resource Protector Service} - it is used to arbitrate the consumption of limited, shared resources (like network bandwidth).}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OCM Family}

As part of work on OMIS (See section~\ref{ssec:omis}) several tools that are compliant with this interface where introduced. This tool set includes: OCM\footnote{\url{http://www.lrr.in.tum.de/Par/tools/Projects/OCM.html}}, OCM-G\footnote{\url{http://grid.cyfronet.pl/ocmg}}, J-OCM\footnote{\url{http://jocm.icsr.agh.edu.pl/sub/main}} and G-PM\footnote{\url{http://gpm.icsr.agh.edu.pl}}.

OCM (\cite{RWspdt98, RW:ppam99b}) - OMIS Compliant Monitoring System is the first tool in whole set. Work on this project started in 1997. The main goal of this project was to create a reference implementation of an OMIS compliant monitoring system. Initially it supported PVM (versions 3.3 and 3.4) and MPI-1. 

As a next step in platform evolution, OCM-G, which states for Grid-enabled OMIS-Compliant Monitoring system (\cite{axgrid03b}) was introduced. This project focuses on using OMIS interface with grid environments.  In spite of working with well known MPI parallel programming library, it was designed to work with Globus Toolkit and is fully compliant with EGEE environment including gLite 3.x\footnote{\url{http://glite.cern.ch/}} and LCG 2.7. 

The last addition to set OMIS-compliant tools is J-OCMG - Java oriented monitoring infrastructure (\cite{jocm}). It adds ability of monitoring JVM-based applications. It extended standard OMIS interface with a set of new, Java-specific services, like garbage collection, threads execution, class loading or method invocation. Currently project implementation focuses on monitoring Java Web Services and component oriented applications.

General architecture shared among all mentioned above systems can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:ocmg}.

\subsection{R-GMA}

R-GMA: Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture~(\cite{RGMA1,RGMA2,RGMA3}) is implementation of GMA, described in section~\ref{ssec:gma}. Although it implements GMA interface, it adds two exceptions to the standard. First, anyone supplying or obtaining information from R-GMA does not need to know about the Registry component, as it\rq{}s responsibility is processed by Consumer and Producer components \lq\lq{}behind the scenes\rq\rq{}. The second exception is that information and monitoring system appears like one large relational database and can be queried as such. The second exception is source of R (Relational) in project name.

All systems using R-GMA shared information in a virtual database, with data organized into table, and managed using standard SQL constructs (like INSERT INTO... or SELECT * FROM). Regarding internal database structure, there is no central repository that actually holds the data for each table. Virtual database just consists of a list of table definitions (\emph{schema}), a list of data providers (\emph{registry}) and a set of rules for deciding which data providers needs to be used while preparing result for given query. These rules are fixed and encoded into a internal component called \emph{mediator}.

The system provides several ways to access the database. There are provided API, with bindings available in Java, C/C++ and Python. Additionally users can work with database using web interface or command line utility.
