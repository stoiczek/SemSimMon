\makebox{\large Abstract}

{\small
Software engineering like any other technical discipline requires deep analysis of problem domain prior to starting any new work. It is required to analyze work of other teams for many reasons, including learning from their mistakes, looking for good ideas that fit into given project or just for an inspiration. This chapter focuses solely on researching problem domain. Firstly, I would like to describe projects related to systems measuring, mostly distributed processing environments, measuring standards. Later on, I am trying to discuss other projects with similar functionality - measuring efficiency of other software. End of this chapter focuses solely on semantic aspect of subject, reader may find there rough description of what is this \lq\lq{}semantic\rq\rq{} thing as well as description of technologies that were created to constitute this term.
