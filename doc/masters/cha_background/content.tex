\label{cha:background}

\chabstract{
Software engineering, unlike any other technical discipline requires deep analysis of the problem domain, prior to starting any new work. Creation of new systems requires to analyze the work of other teams for many reasons, including learning from their mistakes, looking for a bright ideas that fit into a given project or just for an inspiration. This chapter focuses solely on researching the problem domain. Firstly, I would like to describe some projects related to the systems measurement, mostly in distributed processing environments an measurement standards. Later on, I am trying to discuss other projects with a similar functionality. The end of this chapter focuses solely on the semantic aspect of Thesis, the reader may find there a rough description of what is this \lq\lq{}semantic\rq\rq{} thing, as well as a description of technologies that were created to constitute this term.
